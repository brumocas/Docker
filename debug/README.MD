## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Docker concepts.
- Docker installed on your machine. Follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you haven't installed Docker yet.

## Common Debugging Commands

### Viewing Logs

Logs are a crucial resource for understanding what is happening inside your containers.

- **View container logs:**
  ```sh
  docker logs <container_name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker logs my_nginx
  ```

- **Stream container logs:**
  ```sh
  docker logs -f <container_name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker logs -f my_nginx
  ```

### Inspecting Containers

The `docker inspect` command provides detailed information about Docker objects.

- **Inspect a container:**
  ```sh
  docker inspect <container_name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker inspect my_nginx
  ```

- **Inspect an image:**
  ```sh
  docker inspect <image_name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker inspect nginx
  ```

### Accessing Containers

Sometimes, you need to get inside a running container to understand its state.

- **Access a running container:**
  ```sh
  docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker exec -it my_nginx /bin/bash
  ```

If the container does not have `bash`, you can use `sh` or other available shells.

## Debugging Techniques

### Interactive Shell

Running an interactive shell inside a container can help diagnose issues.

- **Run a container with an interactive shell:**
  ```sh
  docker run -it <image_name> /bin/bash
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
  ```

### Dockerfile Debugging

When building images, it's common to encounter issues with the Dockerfile.

- **Build an image and display detailed output:**
  ```sh
  docker build --progress=plain -f <path_to_dockerfile> .
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker build --progress=plain -f Dockerfile .
  ```

- **Use multi-stage builds to isolate and debug:**
  ```dockerfile
  FROM node:14 AS build
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY . .
  RUN npm install
  RUN npm run build

  FROM nginx:alpine
  COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
  ```

### Network Troubleshooting

Networking issues can be challenging but are crucial to resolve.

- **List all networks:**
  ```sh
  docker network ls
  ```

- **Inspect a network:**
  ```sh
  docker network inspect <network_name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker network inspect bridge
  ```

- **Test connectivity between containers:**
  ```sh
  docker exec -it <container_name> ping <target_container_name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker exec -it my_nginx ping my_db
  ```

### Volume Issues

Volumes are used to persist data, and issues with volumes can cause data loss or corruption.

- **List all volumes:**
  ```sh
  docker volume ls
  ```

- **Inspect a volume:**
  ```sh
  docker volume inspect <volume_name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker volume inspect my_volume
  ```

- **Run a container with a volume and check permissions:**
  ```sh
  docker run -it -v <volume_name>:<container_path> <image_name> /bin/bash
  ```
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker run -it -v my_volume:/data ubuntu /bin/bash
  ```

## Best Practices

- **Keep containers small and single-purpose:** This makes them easier to debug and maintain.
- **Use version control for Dockerfiles:** Track changes and collaborate effectively.
- **Monitor containers:** Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Docker's built-in stats.
- **Regularly update images:** Ensure you are using the latest, most secure versions.
